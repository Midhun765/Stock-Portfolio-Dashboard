One of the major problems I faced was the fetching data from google finance and yahoo finance. I tried scrapping from yahoo and tried unofficial apis of yahoo finance. But all had some issue like there were no Indian listing or we were not authorized etc. Finally I was able to get the yahoo data from yahoo-finance2 npm package. Even with it there was the problem that the symbol for finding the stock was not the same as stock exchange code for BOM. It used the NSE code itself with the suffix as .BO. I couldn't convert all the BOM stocks to its' counter part because some of the listing were not there in yahoo finance. So I decided to scrape from the website if there really was a listing and the NSE code of the stock. After that I converted it to the proper form and used it in the package.
